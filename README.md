# Bio

Manuel is a security researcher specializing in Ethereum and EVM at Spearbit, where he serves as a Lead Security Researcher (LSR). His journey with Ethereum began in 2016.

Over the past three years, he has reviewed more than 50 codebases, uncovered critical vulnerabilities across multiple DeFi protocols, and contributed to improving their overall design.

At Spearbit, Manuel has reviewed codebases for Uniswap, Base, Optimism, MakerDAO, Aztec, Usual, Monad, OP-succinct, Llama, and many more.

Previously, he was a Lead Engineer at [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io), where he designed and developed smart contracts securing over $250 million in TVL and enabled the first real-world assets (RWAs) on [MakerDAO](https://twitter.com/SebVentures/status/1384947049012006913).

Manuel worked over the years with multiple security companies as a client (Trail of Bits, DappHub, Least Authority, Code4Arena). Over time, his growing interest in security led him to fully transition into the field. He is currently serving as an Independent Security Researcher (LSR) at [Spearbit](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio), previously at [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/). 

He holds a BSc in Computer Science from [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/) and an MSc in Computer Science from [FU Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). 

Manuel also actively contributed to projects like [Radicle Drips](https://github.com/drips-network/contracts/) a highly optimized streaming protocol for open source dependency funding where he was involved in the design and reviewed all PRs of the first versions.
